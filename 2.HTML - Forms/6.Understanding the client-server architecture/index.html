    <!--?  See the pratical example  of client interaction -->
    <!-- Suppose if the user or client want to login to any website so they enter there credentials  -->
     <h3>Login Page of XYZ Company</h3>
     <form>
        <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username">
        <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password">
        <button>Login</button>
     </form>
     <!--* When a user fills out a login form and enters their username and password, this data is sent to the server over the internet. The server processes the request and checks the credentials by querying the database. If the credentials match an existing user, the server allows the user to log in to the application. If not, it might show an error or ask the user to register. The server then sends a response back to the frontend to show the result to the user.  -->
