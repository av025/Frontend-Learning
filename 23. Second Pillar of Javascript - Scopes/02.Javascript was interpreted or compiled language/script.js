//! Javascript was Interpreted or Compiled language  
//* Before understanding the nature of javascript first we understand what was means interpreted or compiled language 

//?  Interpreted language 
//* In an interpreted language, a tool or software (called an interpreter) processes the code line by line, converting it into machine language and then executing it immediately.

//* This approach is generally slower than compiled languages, because instead of converting the entire code into machine language at once, the interpreter checks and executes each line one at a time, also checking for any syntax or runtime errors during the process. 

//* Example : c , c++ etc 


//? Compiled language 
//* In a compiled language, a tool or software (called a compiler) processes the entire code in one go.
//* It translates the whole code into machine language and creates an executable file.
//* After that, the program is executed from this file.
//* One drawback is that errors are only detected during the compilation phase, not line by line like in interpreted languages.
//* However, compiled languages are usually faster than interpreted ones because the entire code is already converted into machine code before execution.

//* Example : python , shell etc
