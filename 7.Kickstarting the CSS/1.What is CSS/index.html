    <h1>What is CSS</h1>
    <!-- CSS is stand for "Cascading Style Sheet" -->

    <!-- What is the meaning of Cascading ? -->
    <!-- 
    -  The cascade is an algorithm in CSS that helps decide which style to apply when multiple styles target the same HTML element.

    - It works based on the priority (precedence) of different style sources like browser defaults, user styles, and developer styles. The style with the highest precedence (or importance) gets applied.

    -  If two styles have the same precedence, then the one that comes later (lower in the file) will be applied. So, in cases of equal importance, CSS reads from top to bottom, and the last style wins.-->

<!-- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to make our webpages look visually appealing. It helps us style HTML elements according to our needs.

With CSS, we can:

Create layouts for our webpages

Add spacing between elements

Set background colors

Change text colors and fonts

And much more to improve the overall look and feel of our web applications or websites.

In short, everything that makes a website look beautiful and well-structured is done using CSS. -->
