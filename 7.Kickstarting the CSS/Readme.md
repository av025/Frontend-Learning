# Kickstarting the CSS 
In this section, we begin our styling journey in frontend development with **CSS**, which stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**.

### What is "Cascading"?

The term **"cascading"** refers to the algorithm used by browsers to determine **which style takes precedence** when multiple styles (from different sources like the browser, user, or author) are applied to the same element. 

CSS follows a **top-to-bottom flow**, which means that if multiple styles are applied, the **last (bottom) style will override** the earlier ones, depending on their **specificity and importance**.

### CSS Selectors

We explored basic CSS properties and the most important concept: **selectors**. With selectors, we can **target specific HTML elements** and apply styles to them.

#### Types of Selectors:

- **Type or Element Selector**
- **Universal Selector**
- **ID Selector**
- **Class Selector**
- **Combinator Selectors** (which allow us to style elements based on relationships like parent â†’ child)

### Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements

#### ðŸ”¹ Pseudo-Classes:
These let us **style elements based on their state** (like `:hover`, `:focus`), even though these states are **not directly visible** in the HTML.

#### ðŸ”¹ Pseudo-Elements:
These allow us to **insert extra content** or **style specific parts** of an element (like `::before`, `::after`) **without modifying the actual HTML**.

### Conclusion

Overall, this section gave us a strong foundation for using **CSS** to create **visually appealing web pages**.
