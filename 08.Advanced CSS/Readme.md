# Advanced CSS

In this section, we learned some important and useful parts of advanced CSS.

##  Box Model

- The **Box Model** helps us understand how elements are spaced and sized.
- It has 4 main parts:
  - **Content** – The main part (like text or image)
  - **Padding** – Space inside the box, around the content
  - **Border** – The edge around the padding
  - **Margin** – Space outside the box, separating it from other elements
- We also learned about the `box-sizing` property:
  - `content-box` adds padding and border outside the width/height.
  - `border-box` includes padding and border inside the width/height.

##  Flexbox Layout

- **Flexbox** is a simple way to place elements in a row or column.
- It’s the first layout method we usually learn when starting layout design.
- Helps to make our design responsive and easy to manage.

##  CSS Gradients

- **Gradients** are smooth transitions between 2 or more colors.
- Used as background for better visual design.
- Types of gradients:
  - **Linear Gradient**
  - **Radial Gradient**
  - **Conic Gradient**

This gave us a strong base in layout and visual design using CSS.
