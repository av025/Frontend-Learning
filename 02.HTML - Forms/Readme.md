# HTML - Forms
In HTML, forms are used to collect user input and interact with a website. We create a form using the `<form>` tag, and within it, we commonly use various `<input>` elements to gather data such as text, passwords, or selections.

These input fields allow users to enter information, which is then sent to the backend server for processingâ€”forming the basis of a client-server architecture.

Learning the fundamentals of HTML forms is essential, as they play a key role in user interaction and data submission on web applications.
