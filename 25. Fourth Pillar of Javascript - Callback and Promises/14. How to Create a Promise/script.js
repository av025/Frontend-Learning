//! How to create a promises ???? 
//* In documentation of ECMAscript there was given the reference of promises object it means promises was native feature of javascript handling javascript in synchronous in nature.

//* It means promise object was synchronous in nature that was partially true but the creation of promises was the synchronous. 
// * As we know that it creates the placeholder for the eventual result of a deferred (it means leave something on later time) that's was asynchronous  

//? Promises have mainly three state : 
//* 1st. Pending : 
//?  - When we create the new promise object than pending was the default state.
//?  - It represent the work in progress state. 
//* 2nd. Fullfiled : 
//? If the progress was completed than this pending state was migrated to fullfiled state. 
//* 3rd. Rejected : 
//? If the progress was not completed successfully than this pending state was migrated to Rejected state.
