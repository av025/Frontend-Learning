# CSS Animations 

In modern web design, CSS provides three core tools to animate and enhance user interfaces without JavaScript:

## `transform`
Allows you to visually manipulate elements by rotating, scaling, skewing, or translating them on the screen. It's used to create effects like flips, moves, and zooms.

## `transition`
Enables smooth changes between two states (e.g., on `:hover`). You control what changes, how long it takes, and the easing effect, making interactions feel polished.

## `@keyframes`
Used to build complex, multi-step animations that can loop or run once. Define stages of animation and apply them using the `animation` property.

These features combined help bring life and interactivity to your web pages with minimal code.
