//! Behaviour and Properties of an Object

//* → As we understand, in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), we use classes to create a blueprint of any real-life entity.
//* → For example, a `Product` class can define what properties a product has (like name, model, company, price) and what actions (behavior) it can perform (like buy, cancel, add to cart, remove from cart).

//? → One important point: the behavior (i.e., actions/functions) defined in the class remains common for all instances (objects) of that class.
//? → However, the properties (i.e., values/data) of each object should be unique to distinguish one object from another.

//? → For instance, two products may have the same actions (buy, cancel, etc.), but their data (like name, price, model) should differ at least in one property.

//! → In technical terms:
//*     - The properties of an object (like `name`, `price`, `company`) are called "Data Members".
//*     - The actions or methods (like `buyProduct()`, `cancelProduct()`, etc.) are called "Member Functions".
