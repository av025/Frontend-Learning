//! Introduction to OOPs
//* In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), we follow the concept of blueprints.
//* This blueprint is a mental model that represents how a real-world entity looks and behaves.

//* For example, in an e-commerce application, we may have a "Product" entity.
//* A product has properties like: 
//   name, model, price, company, review, rating, etc. â€” these describe the product.

//* A product also performs some actions or behaviors, such as:
//   buy the product, cancel the order, get product details, add to cart, remove from cart, etc.

//* So, by using this mental blueprint, we can define the structure and behavior of any product.

//? In technical terms, this blueprint is called a **class**.

//* Using this class, we can create multiple real-world products with different data (properties).

// Example:
// product 1:
//   name: "Laptop"
//   model: "15th Generation"
//   price: 120000
//   company: "HP"
//   review: "Best budget and performance laptop"
//   rating: 4.5

// product 2:
//   name: "iPhone"
//   model: "16th Generation"
//   price: 100000
//   company: "Apple"
//   review: "Best phone with great features"
//   rating: 4.4

//? Technically, these individual products created from the class are called **objects**.
//* And these objects are just like the JavaScript objects you've already been using.

//*  So in short:
//   A class is the **blueprint**, and
//   Objects are the **real instances** created from that blueprint.
