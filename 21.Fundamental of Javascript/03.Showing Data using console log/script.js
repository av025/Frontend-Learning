//! Showing Data using console log  
//* In javascript if we want to showing data or do output than we used the functions to print the data on the standard output 

//? What was Functions in programming language ? 
//* We say functions was a block box in which we give any input and return output for it in general term, so function is a reusable block of code in which we give instruction of codes to do perform any task and return output. 

//! First function in Javascript 
//* There was lot of inbuilt functions in javascript but for showing data or giving output on the standard output screen with the help of "console.log" 

//! Console.log Function 
// For printing purpose we use the console.log function to print anything on the standard output and it was function the "log" in which we give input and it returns output.
//? In this console.log function we can print anything like numbers, words , do computation etc and we can give multiple input also.

// first example 
console.log(2) //* Output was 2 
console.log(10) //* Output was 10 
console.log("Aayush Vyas") //* Output was "Aayush Vyas"
// We can do computation also like adding two numbers 
console.log(2 + 2) //* output was 4 = 2 + 2  

//? Printing variable with the help of console.log function 
let myAge = 26; //* variable myAge 

// let's print the variable myAge 
console.log(myAge) //* output was 26 
//? As we understand that with the help of variable we can reuse our memory address as a reference when we create variable 

//! We can give multiple input in log function also let see example of it ... 
console.log( 2 + 2, "Aayush", " Vyas", 100);
//* With the help of comma operator we can give the multiple input and it return multiple output
