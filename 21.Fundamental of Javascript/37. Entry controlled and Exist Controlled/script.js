//! Entry Controlled and Exist Controlled Loops in Programming Language 

//? Entry Controlled Loops 
//* The Entry controlled loops are those loops in which entry was control for example while and for loop 

// While loop  
let variableOne = 1; 

while(variableOne <= 5) {
    console.log(variableOne); 
    variableOne++; 
} 

// For loop 
for(let variableTwo = 0; variableTwo <= 5; variableTwo++) {
    console.log(variableTwo);
}


//? Exist Controlled Loops 
//* Exist controlled loops are those loops in which exist was control for example do-while loop 

// Do-While loop 
let variableThree = 1; 

do {
    console.log(variableThree); 
    variableThree++; 
}while(variableThree <= 5);
