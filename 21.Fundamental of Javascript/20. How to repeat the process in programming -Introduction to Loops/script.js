//! How to repeat the process in programming - Introduction to Loops 

//? Whenever we have to do things repeatedly in programming language we use loops with the help of loops we can repeat process for certain time or upto that task. 

//* There was different type of loops : 

//? Let see example of looping 
// Write the program to prints the number from 1 to 10.
