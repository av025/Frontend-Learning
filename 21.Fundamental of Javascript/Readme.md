In this section on the Fundamentals of JavaScript, we explored the basics of JavaScript â€” what JavaScript is, why it was created, and how it works. We learned that JavaScript is a dynamic, scripting, and object-oriented language.

We also covered key foundational topics such as:

- What variables are and how to create them

- An introduction to type coercion

- Various operators and conditional statements

- An introduction to functions

- Non-primitive data types like Arrays and Objects
