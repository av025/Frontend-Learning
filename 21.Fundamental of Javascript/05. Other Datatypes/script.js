//! Other Datatypes in JS 

//* Null Type : When we say null which means nothing when we represent null type it actually means empty value on other hand we have other type which was undefined which we see previously which also used to give empty value for specific situation than after that we can give assign value to that . 

// let see example of null type and undefined type 
var myAge; 
//? Above variable myAge was undefined because we don't assign value just declare variable now. Later we defined or assign the value also 
//! Here we assign the value implicit manner we can use undefined keyword also to assign the value which was explicitly giving value.

var disibility = null; //* Here we assign the value null to variable disbility 
console.log(myAge); //! Output : undefined 
console.log(disibility); //! Output : null
